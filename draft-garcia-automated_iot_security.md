--- abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication. 
The security needs are well-recognized and and many standardization steps for providing security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). 
However, the design space of IoT applications and systems is complex and exposed to multiple types of threats.
In particular, threats keep evolving at a fast pace while many IoT systems are rarely updated and still remain operational for decades. 

This document has three main parts:
First, it summarizes exemplary security threats and suitable mitigation strategies to protect against multiple types of threats.
Second, it describes a comprehensive agile security framework to integrate existing security processes such as risk asssement or vulnerability assessment in the lifecycle of a smart object in an IoT application. 
Thus, instead of having a security configuration that is fixed at manufacturing time, our approach allows us to apply a -- security profile -- on the device tailored for a specific environment at any point of time.
Third, we discuss the concept of security profiles and give examples of them.

The core of our agile security approach relies on two protocols: the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA). 
PACS is executed during the onboarding phase of a smart object in an IoT system and is in charge of automatically performing a risk assessment and assigning a security profile to defeat the identified risks. The assigned security profile fits the specific environment and threat model of the application in which the device has been deployed. 
PAVA is executed during the operation of the IoT object and ensures that vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system are discovered in a proactive way. 
These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures and operators by automating IoT security.
We describe a few examplary security profiles that could be applicable in different application areas and automatically configured by means of PASC and PAVA.

# Introduction {#sec2}

The Internet of Things (IoT) denotes the interconnection of highly heterogeneous networked entities and networks following a number of communication patterns such as: human-to-human (H2H), human-to-thing (H2T), thing-to-thing (T2T), or thing-to-things (T2Ts). The term IoT was first coined by the Auto-ID center {{AUTO-ID}} in 1999. Since then, the development of the underlying concepts has ever increased its pace. Nowadays, the IoT presents a strong focus of research with various initiatives working on the (re)design, application, and usage of standard Internet technology in the IoT.

The IoT is exposed to a high number of attack vectors, that if sucessfully exploited by an attacker can have severe consequences.
Thus, this document firstly provides an overview of general threats.

Which mitigation strategies are most suitable to and required in an IoT system depends on several factors, including, the operational features of the IoT system or the threats that are applicable to that system.
Thus, this document further discusses processes that facilitate the proper design and operation of secure IoT systems, namely business impact analysis, risk assessment, privacy impact analysis, vulnerability analyis and incident reporting.
We further argue that even if these processes help IoT system designers to make secure products, a better approach would be to fully integrate these processes in the lifecycle of a smart object in an IoT application.
The reason is that IoT products are designed assuming a given environment and threat model that determines the require mitigation strategies. However, in practice, a IoT product can be deployed in very different environments and very different threat models. 
Furthermore, while threats keep appearing at a very fast pace, IoT systems remain operational -- with limited amount of updates -- for a very long period of time.

Thus, in order to integrate security processes in the IoT lifecycle, we describe two protocols, the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PACS) and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA).
These two protocols allow us to integrate risk analysis, privacy impact analysis, and vulnerability assessments in the actual lifecycle of the smart objects so that smart objects can be configured -- continuously -- with security profiles tailored to the very specific environment in which they are deployed.

Finally, this document describes diffent four exemplary security profiles, each comprising a set of threats, mitigation strategies, and configuration parameters,  that would be automatically applied to smart objects when joining different environments.

The rest of the Internet-Draft is organized as follows. 
Section {{sec3}} summarizes the design space of secure IoT systems, including lifecycle, device capabilities, and operational features. 
Section {{sec4}} discusses general threats that should be considered when designing and operating an IoT system. 
In Section {{sec5}}, general mitigation strategies to the identified threats are listed.
Choosing which mitigation strategies apply to which use cases is not trivial since it is required to find a proper balance between security, cost and usuability. 
Thus, Section {{sec6}} details methodologies for managing risks when designing a secure IoT system and dealing with vulnerabilities when operating the system. 
This section further describes how these methodologies can be integrated in the lifecycle of a smart object.
Section {{sec7}} proposes the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) that allows moving methodologies for risk  assessment and privacy impact analysis from the implementation to the onboarding phase of a device. 
This is enforced since each device discloses its operational requirements when joining an IoT system, and at this specific point of time, a security profile is applied to the device.
Section {{sec8}} describes the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA) that allows gathering information on potential vulnerabilities as detected by different devices so that vulnerabilities are detected and action can be taken, including the creation of incident reports delivered to the user and manufacturers. 
Section {{sec9}} describes how manufactures and users will benefit from PASC and PAVA when creating or using IoT systems.
Finally, {{sec10}} proposes a number of illustrative security profiles applicable to different illustrative clases of IoT systems. 
Each security profile comprises a set of mitigation strategies can provide a suitable security level and can be automatically deployed using PASC.
Section {{sec11}} includes final remarks and conclusions.


# The design space of secure IoT systems {#sec3}

This section describes the design space of IoT systems regarding two aspects: a) the lifecycle of a device and b) how an IoT system is architectured.

## The Thing Lifecycle {#sec3-1}

The lifecycle of a thing refers to the operational phases of a thing in the context of a given application or use case. {{fig1}} shows the generic phases of the lifecycle of a thing. This generic lifecycle is applicable to very different IoT applications and scenarios.

We consider an example, a Building Automation and Control (BAC) system, to illustrate the lifecycle and the meaning of these different phases. 
A BAC system consists of a network of interconnected nodes that performs various functions in the domains of HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning), lighting, safety etc. The nodes vary in functionality and a majority of them represent resource constrained devices such as sensors and luminaries. Some devices may also be battery operated or battery-less nodes, demanding for a focus on low energy consumption and on sleeping devices.
In our example, the life of a thing starts when it is manufactured. Due to the different application areas (i.e., HVAC, lighting, safety) nodes are tailored to a specific task. It is therefore unlikely that one single manufacturer will create all nodes in a building. Hence, interoperability as well as trust bootstrapping between nodes of different vendors is important. The thing is later installed and commissioned within a network by an installer during the bootstrapping phase. Specifically, the device identity and the secret keys used during normal operation are provided to the device during this phase. Different subcontractors may install different IoT devices for different purposes. Furthermore, the installation and bootstrapping procedures may not be a defined event but may stretch over an extended period of time. After being bootstrapped, the device and the system of things are in operational mode and execute the functions of the BAC system. During this operational phase, the device is under the control of the system owner. For devices with lifetimes spanning several years, occasional maintenance cycles may be required. During each maintenance phase, the software on the device can be upgraded or applications running on the device can be reconfigured. The maintenance tasks can thereby be performed either locally or from a backend system by means of an end-to-end connection. Depending on the operational changes of the device, it may be required to re-bootstrap at the end of a maintenance cycle. The device continues to loop through the operational phase and the eventual maintenance phase until the device is decommissioned at the end of its lifecycle. However, the end-of-life of a device does not necessarily mean that it is defective but rather denotes a need to replace and upgrade the network to next-generation devices in order to provide additional  functionality. Therefore the device can be removed and re-commissioned to be used in a different system under a different owner by starting the lifecycle all over again.

## Classifying IoT Use Cases {#sec3-2}

An IoT system is architectured according to four main aspects below.

1. Device: what is the role of the devices, what their capabilities are, and which assumptions are posed on them. 

2. Network: how the communication happens either in the local network or going towards remote systems.

3. Application and user: requirements and assumptions of the application running on multiple devices on required input information or interactions with the users.

4. System: interacions between multiple devices and users.

## Examplary use cases and security challenges {#sec3-3}

One of the challenges for IoT security is the diversity in IoT systems and use cases. Examples of use cases with different needs are as follows:

1. A lighting system that runs in a fully isolated manner and only requires some initial interaction by to user to associate a light bulb to a switch.

2. A personal healthcare system in which a user carries medical sensors that monitor the user's health status in real time and allows the user to share this information with his family doctor.

3. A heating, ventilation and air conditioning system used in a office building that allows controlling settings.

4. A nation-wide smart grid that allows controlling the electrical grid including tasks such as demand-response.

5. A smart home environment in which multiple devices targeted for different applications (e.g., smart lighting, smart lock, smart scale, ) can be integrated.

# Security Threats {#sec4}

Different use cases have different types of threats.

In the following, we describe specific threats. This list is not exhaustive and can be further extended in the future.

1. Cloning of things

2. Counterfeiting

3. Malicious substitution of thing

4. Eavesdropping attack

5. Message injection

6. Message modification

7. Man-in-the-middle attack

8. Firmware Replacement attack

9. Extraction of private information

10. Routing attack

11. Timing attacks

12. Privacy threat - identification

13. Privacy threat - localization

14. Privacy threat - profiling

15. Privacy threat - interaction

16. Privacy threat - lifecycle transitions

17. Privacy threat - inventory attacks

18. Privacy threat - linkage

19. Data leakage - cryptographic keys

20. Data leakage - source code

21. Data leakage - propietary algorithms

22. Denial-of-Service attack on device

23. Denial-of-Service attack on network:

24. Store and decrypt attack (Quantum-resistance)

25. Software vulnerabilities

Tables {{fig31}} and {{fig32}} in Section {{sec13}} summarize how these threats apply to different parts of an IoT system at different phases in the device lifecycle.


# Security Mitigations {#sec5}

Deal with the security threats detailed in {{sec4}} requires a number of security mitigations as the ones detailed in Internet Draft {{ID-Moore}}.
In this section, we further detail some of them that will be used later to compose security profiles:

1. Capability to perform an authenticated software update.

2. Capability to perform server authentication.

3. Capability to perform client authentication.

4. Capability to encrypt communications.

5. Capability to encrypt communications.

6. Application isololation.

7. Management gateway.

8. Two factor authentication of application requests.

9. Physical security of the device.

10. Usage of application layer proxy.

11. Regular update of authentication credentials.


# Integrating security processess in the IoT lifecycle {#sec6}

Dealing with above threats and finding suitable security mitigations is challenging: there are very sophisticated threats that a very powerful attacker could use; also, new threats and exploits appear in a daily basis. Therefore, the existence of proper secure product creation processes that allow managing and minimizing risks during the lifecycle of the IoT devices is at least as important as being aware of the threats. A non-exhaustive list of relevant processes include: 

1. A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) assesses the consequences of loss of basic security attributes, namely, confidentiality, integrity and availability in an IoT system. These consequences might include impact on data lost, sales lost, increased expenses, regulatory fines, customer dissatisfaction, etc. Performing a business impact analysis allow determining the business relevance of having a proper security design placing security in the focus.

2. A Risk Assessment (RA) analyzes security threats to the IoT system, considering their likelihood and impact, and deriving for each of them a risk level. Risks classified as moderate or high must be mitigated, i.e., security architecture should be able to deal with that threat bringing the risk to a low level. Note that threats are usually classified according to their goal: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For instance, a specific threat to recover a symmetric-key used in the system relates to confidentiality.

3. A privacy impact assessment (PIA) aims at assessing Personal Identifiable Information (PII) that is collected, processed, or used in the IoT system. By doing so, the goals is to fulfill applicable legal requirements, determine risks and effects of the manipulation of PII, and evaluate proposed protections. 

4. Procedures for vulnerability assessment (VA) aim at assessing whether the IoT system is secure or any vulnerabilities are present. This can be due to changes in the context information such as people involved in the IoT system or new software vulnerabilities discovered. 

5. Procedures for incident reporting (IR) and mitigation refer to the methodologies that allow becoming aware of any security issues that affect an IoT systeoT

Traditionally, BIA, RA, and PIA are usually to be realized during the creation of a new IoT system, introduction of new technologies in the IoT system, or deployment of significant system upgrades. In general, it is recommended to re-assess them on a regular basis taking into account new use cases or threats. VA is also often realized before deployment, e.g., by performing a penetration test before the new product release is deployed. 
Incident reporting is done during operation of the IoT system, when a vulnerability is discovered.

All these processes, namely BIA, RA, PIA, VA, and IR, are a must in the design of any IoT system. If they are not performed, the risk of not having a secure enough system is very high.
However, even if these procedures are in place, the IoT systems can still have an unsatisfactory security level due to multiple reasons:

1. First example: a risk assessment is performed, but the product is deployed in an environment in which the threats and boundaries are different. This leads to the situation in which an IoT system was properly designed, but it is being used in an environment with different security needs.

2. Second example: a risk assessment is performed during the design phase, then also a vulnerability assessment is executed including a penetration test and the product is released to the customers. Some time later, new vulnerabilities appear in a new devices that was installed in the same IoT network. This leads to the situation in which an IoT system was properly designed and tested for vulnerabilities, but it becomes later unsecured due to changes in the environment.

Thus, the authors believe that the above procedures should be fully integrated in the lifecycle of a smart object as showed in {{fig4}}. 
BIA still takes place during the design phase of the new IoT device.
However, RA and PIA are moved now to the installation and commissioning phases of the devices since it is then when the actual environment in which smart objects are deployed is really known.
The VA keeps running during the operation of the IoT system.
Information gathered during VA can feed the RA and PIA processes to update security settings.
Similarly, security incidents found out during continuous VA lead to IR.
When smart objects are sold or the system updated, this triggers again RA and PIA.

In Section {{sec7}} we describe the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PACS) that addresses how to solve the integration of the RA and PIA processes in the installation and commissioning phase.
Then, in Section {{sec8}} we describe the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment that addresses how to perform continuous vulnerability assessment. 

# Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) {#sec7}

Traditional IoT systems are created from scratch and require a suitable security design following the phases descrbed in Section {{sec6}}.
Many generic IoT platforms are emerging that can be instantiated in different products that can be deployed in many different environments.
Thus, we describe the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) that enables automatic security configuration by shifting methodologies for risk management from the tailored product design and implementation phases to the onboarding phase.

{: #fig5 title="Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration."}

{{fig5}} depicts the main parties involved in the protocol: two smart objects denoted as 'Thing1' and 'Thing2', a  device controlling the IoT domain called 'GW', a router towards the IoT domain, the manufacturer server of 'Thing1' denoted as 'M1' and the server of the platform denoted as 'platform'.

The main protocol steps of PASC are as follows:
When 'Thing1' is introduced in the IoT domain, 'Thing1' first publishes its profile to the available 'GW' in message 'm1'.
'GW' then gathers information from 'm1' regarding 'Thing1' in messages 'm2' and 'm3'.
At this stage, 'GW' has information about the available smart objects in the IoT domain and also can gather input from the user on the usage and expected interactions of the smart object with other devices in the deployment environment.
Thus, 'GW' can perform an automated risk assessment of the IoT device in the security domain determining potential threats on the device and on the system, and assigning a security profile containing security mitigations to the identified threats.
In messages 'm4' and 'm5' the GW can gather security updates from 'platform' that might be required for the new situation after the introduction of 'Thing1' in the IoT security domain.
Finally, messages 'm6', 'm7' and 'm8' are used to deploy updated security profiles to the new smart object 'Thing1' and potentially also to other devices already present in the deployment environment, namely, the 'router' and other smart objects (e.g., 'Thing2').

In practice, PACS can be created by extending and combining a number of protocols.
Messages 'm1', 'm2', and 'm3' resemble steps of the Manufacturer Usage Descriptor (MUD) protocol.
After these messages, RA and PIA can be executed given available information on the expected usage of the devices and input from the user.
Messages 'm4' and 'm5' require standardization since they resemble the access for various software updates that might be required to fullfil security needs.
Configuration messages 'm6' and 'm7' might be instantiated by a combination and extension of ACE and MUD protocol.
Message 'm8' requires standarization to automatically configure router and firewall rules.

# Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA) {#sec8}

Today vulnerability assessment is either not performed at all or it is only performed when products are designed.
The Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA) overcomes this.
PAVA relies on each smart object (e.g., Thing1) sending standarized reports of potential vulnerabilities to 'GW', the device managing the IoT security domain.
Such reports would build on RFC 5424, RFC 5425 and RFC 5426. Reports and methodology can also benefit from RFC6872. 
The 'GW' then analyzes the logs and takes a decision regarding the existence of a vulnerability, its origin and its impact.
Output of this decision is threefold:  

1. incident report towards the user
2. update of security profiles in smart objects of the IoT security domain.
3. automatic incident reporting towards the manufacturer
4. automatic incident reporting towards the platform provider

# Benefits of integrating security processes in the IoT lifecycle through PASC and PAVA {#sec9}


Section {{sec8}} describes how manufacturers, system operators and end users benefit from PASC and PAVA when creating, making or using IoT systems.

Users benefit since security configuration is done in an automatic way -- they need to do nothing. 
Security settings are automatically configured according to the specific deployment environment that a user only needs to confirm.

Manufacturers benefit since they do not need to decide which security mitigations they require on a product. Instead of it, they just need to describe the expected usage of the product that is then confirmed by the user. Security profiles are then automatically deployed on the smart object.

System operators use these protocols to minimize operational cost while ensuring that the system remains secure at any moment.

# Security Profiles {#sec10}

We expect the various types of IoT deployments to be widespread and to penetrate almost all areas of our personal and professional life including building automation systems, healthcare, smart cities, logistics, etc. For each of these environments, properties such as device capabilities, network infrastructure, or available security services can be completely different. That makes it difficult to define and deploy complete security configurations for each generic use case. Furthermore, each of those applications is featured by a different number of actors deployed in very different environments and with very different purposes. Consequently, when a Business Impact Analysis or Risk Assessment is performed, not only the types of threats will be different, but also their likelihood and potential impact. This determines that different applications tend to require different or complementary types of security mechanisms mitigating the identified risks. 

This section describes some exemplary Security Profiles that can be automatically created by means of PASC fitting the security needs of applications with the same characteristics and requirements. These security profiles are beneficial since they make the underlying threats transparent, allow for interoperability while preserving security and prevent possible security misconfiguration.
It is expected that the security profiles defined in this section need to be extended and adapted based on the individual risk profiles of each environment as described in {{sec6}} of this document.

Each security profile includes:

1. a short descriptive name,
2. an exemplary application that might use the security profile,
3. the main security threats applicable to the profile,
4. the security mitigations required by the profile,
5. specific configuration parameters for the protocols and actors involved in the application.

## Classes of IoT Systems {#sec10-1}

Based on the PASC the IoT devices can be grouped by function, by required access and by deployment scope into individual IoT device classes. While grouping things into individual device classes based on function and required access is a universal part of each PASC independent of the desired deployment environment, the deployment scope MUST be considered as well based on the different threats in various deployment environments. For example, the same thing deployed in smart homes or in smart cities will have the same PASC entries for function and required access, however, the deployment scope and the inherited security threats from the different environments will require different PASC and PAVA for the two deployment scenarios. 
 
Each one of these IoT device classes will represent an isolated segment in itself and will receive an individual and continuous PAVA during the lifetime of the things in the device class. In order to connect with things in different segments, the management gateway MUST be used.
 
The goal of creating device classes for IoT devices is to enable the near-automatic management of a clear separation of security threats and risk assessments by enforcing device segmentation for each class of devices. This segmentation process SHOULD therefore be automated, but the automation part itself is out of scope for this document. The segments must be pre-defined before the PASC is created. If the PASC requires a new segment to introduce a thing into a certain environment, the segment MUST be defined first. Protocols like MUD SHOULD be used as a valuable source of information during the classification and provisioning process in PASC. 
 
We consider four generic security profiles applicable to four exemplary application areas as summarized in the table below:

{: #fig6 title="Security profiles and application areas."}


The currently existing IoT products can be loosely categorized in 4 different profiles, where SecProf_1 would be the lowest category of security profiles and SecProf_4 would be the highest category of security profiles. It is considered best practice in the security world to allow higher security profiles to connect to lower security profiles, but to never let lower security profiles connect to higher security profiles. The same precautions SHOULD be used for the IoT Security Profiles defined below. The separation between the Security Profiles described in {{fig6}} is not a strict physical separation, but a logical one. A home IoT device and its management software may include components that fall into the SecProf_1 as well as SecProf_2 category. Within every security profile exists a graduation of different security levels. The exact category within a security profile will be determined with a risk analysis of the thing and its functionality and MUST be reviewed on a regular basis. This is because each security profile will contain devices with a high lifecycle variation. Certain IoT devices are meant to be used for a few hours only, while others are expected to last decades. Given the technological progress, the security of a thing may degenerate over time within the same security profile. 

The best mitigation strategy against unknown future threats are software updates, for example, to replace a broken hash algorithm with a more secure one as long as the thing can handle the computational load of the new hash algorithm. 


## Security Profile 1: Home usage {#sec10-2}

SecProf_1 categorizes unmanaged IoT devices mostly found in private homes. The things in this Security Profile are single-purpose devices, used either on a daily or less frequent basis. The types of threats those things will face are usually minimal risk. The likelihood of misuse entirely depends on physical proximity to the thing. 

Given the example of an internet-connected button for the delivery of fresh bananas, it would require physical interaction (“button press”) and SHOULD make use of technologies like fingerprint sensors to limit the order ability to a small set of authorized individuals. A misuse would at maximum lead to an unwanted delivery of fruits, and a supermarket can easily enforce a maximum amount of fruits an individual household would order before assuming malicious intent.

This Security Profile requires unidirectional communication from the thing to a specific service. Additional services like order confirmation will be handled via separate channels. Mitigations for security threats identified in the PASC MUST contain encryption on the transport layer of the application, a strict isolation from other nodes in a shared network and a proper physical placement of the thing. Additionally, a strong identification mechanism, like X.509 Certificates, MUST be used to identify the exact thing that talks to the specific service.

{: #fig61 title="Threats and mitigation strategies for Security Profile 1."}



## Security Profile 2: Managed Home usage {#sec10-3}

SecProf_2 categorizes managed IoT devices mostly found in private homes. The things in this Security Profile are more complex, often multi-purpose devices, and meant to be used on a daily basis. The types of threats those things will face are usually in the medium to high risk category. Misuse of the thing depends on the security of the managed service bundled to the thing. 

Given the example of an smart door lock, the PASC contains physical and logical security risks. The physical security of the lock MUST be on the same standard that non-smart door locks provide. For the logical security of the door lock, physical presence close to the smart door lock MUST be enforced for the unlocking functionality, while the locking functionality might also be used remotely. Key escrow must be possible via a secure procedure for emergency services like Police or the Fire Brigade. 

This Security Profile requires bidirectional communication from the thing to a specific management gateway. All communication with specific services as well as other smart objects MUST go through the management gateway. The management gateway may act as an application layer proxy when it is used as a relay to enable communication between smart objects and nodes within a single domain or local network. Mitigations for security threats identified in the PASC MUST contain encryption on the transport layer of the application and a strict isolation from other nodes except the management gateway in a shared network. Additionally, a strong identification and authentication mechanism, like X.509 Certificates, MUST be used to identify and authenticate the thing when it talks to the management gateway. The credentials used for authentication and authorization MUST be refreshed on a regular basis.  

## Security Profile 3: Industrial usage {#sec10-4}

SecProf_3 categorizes unmanaged or partially managed IoT devices found in industrial or commercial environments. The things in this Security Profile are single-purpose devices, used by a number of unidentified people. The types of threats those things will face are in the minimal or medium risk category. Misuse could lead to a certain inconvenience, but would not put the operation of the industrial or commercial environment at risk.

Given the example of a HVAC system in a commercial office building, the components of such a system would include a central HVAC management service for the building, temperature sensors spread across the whole building and heating and cooling devices at certain places across the building. Communication from the smart objects spread across the building would be unidirectional depending on their functionality. The temperature sensors would unidirectional communicate frequently with the HVAC central management service. The HVAC central management service would unidirectional communicate as needed with the heating and cooling devices to regulate the temperature across the building. 

This Security Profile requires a mix of unidirectional and bidirectional communication between the things and a specific service. Mitigations for security threats identified in the PASC MUST contain encryption on the transport layer of the application, a strict isolation from other nodes in a shared network for the smart things and a strong identification mechanism, like X.509 Certificates, MUST be used to identify the exact thing that talks to the central management service. Mitigations for security threats identified in the PASC for central management service which requires bidirectional communication with multiple things MUST contain encryption on the transport layer of the application and MUST use a strong identification and authorization mechanism, like X.509 Certificates, to identify and authenticate the central management service when it talks to the individual smart objects. The central management service may act as an application layer proxy when it is used as a relay to enable communication between smart objects and nodes within a single domain or local network. The credentials used for authentication and authorization MUST be refreshed on a regular basis.

## Security Profile 4: Managed Industrial usage {#sec10-5}

SecProf_4 categorizes fully managed IoT devices found in industrial or commercial environments. The things in this Security Profile are multi-purpose devices, used by a number of authenticated and authorized people. The types of threats those things will face are in the high risk category. Misuse could lead to a partial or full compromise of the industrial or commercial environment. 

Given the example of a physical security system with managed access in a commercial datacenter, the components of such a system would include components like cameras, infrared sensors, access control systems and fire safety. All components have either unidirectional or bidirectional connectivity to a local or remote management gateway. All communication with specific services as well as other smart objects MUST go through the management gateway. The management gateway controls the functionality of each smart component within the integrated physical security system. The management gateway may act as an application layer proxy when it is used as a relay to enable communication between the individual components of the integrated physical security system and external nodes within a single domain or local and remote networks. 

Mitigations for security threats identified in the PASC MUST contain encryption on the transport layer of the application and a strict isolation from other nodes except the management gateway in a shared network. Additionally, a strong identification and authentication mechanism, like X.509 Certificates, MUST be used to identify and authenticate all IoT components for the communication with the management gateway. The credentials used for authentication and authorization MUST be refreshed on a regular basis.   

# Conclusions {#sec11}

The main contribution of this document is to describe and propose protocols to automate IoT security.
This is done in two steps. 
First, the PASC protocol allows to automatically configure devices and deploying security profiles -- sets of security configurations -- to the devices that join a given network and system.
Second, the PAVA protocol allows to automatically monitor the operation of the network and system in order to defeat any attack.
A key contribution of this document is the definition of exemplary security profiles that can be deploy to the devices.

# Security Considerations {#sec12}


Security is a key factor in the acceptance and long-term success of IoT systems. When comparing established Things that already exists as non-smart versions in the real word for a long time, for example light switches or door locks, and the typical modern approach to software engineering, we can often see a culture clash. This culture clash is not surprising. The reasons for this are simple, the building and manufacturing industry for example are some of the slowest changing industry sectors in the world, often also due to high demands and regulations on safety and security of the physical products they produce, e. g. bridges or houses. On the other side, we have the IT and Web industry, one of the most dynamic industry sectors currently existing. While the formula on how to mix concrete or unlocking a door with a physical key has not changed much in the last 100 years, we went to a huge number of fundamental changes in the software industry in a relatively short period of time. 
 
Additionally, there is a fundamental difference of traditional connected and networked devices "for people" vs. IoT devices which are typically headless.  E. g., many standard application layer authentication mechanisms like OAuth assume a person is there to "do something" in a challenge response sequence. Also, people have an identity, that typically links to authorization of resources, while an IoT device is more single-purpose and typically has no intrinsic sense of other resources it might/should communicate with. This distinction between devices lends itself to a number of considerations in terms of authentication, access control, manageability, and other challenges that will take time to properly normalize in a modern IoT enabled world.
 
From a security perspective, it is difficult to trust IoT devices. There are simply too many of them, and due to their constrained nature there are often compromises that weaken security overall. Most IoT devices are typically focused on their physical task rather than on being general purpose computing platforms. Therefore, the security profiles described in this document aim to bridge the initial risk analysis gap between the involved industry sectors and put a higher emphasis on the minimizing risk and containing the blast radius factors.

# Summary of threats {#sec13}

We can classify threats presented in Section {{sec4}} according to two criteria: a) what is the target of the threat? and b) when does the threat take place?

The target of the threat can be -- as described in {{sec3-2}} -- the IoT architecture (T-arch), the device (T-dev), the network (T-nwk), and the application (T-app).
The lifecycle moment in which the threat takes place can be -- as described in {{sec3-1}} -- during manufacturing (L-make), commissioning process (L-conf), operation (L-oper), software updates (L-update), and decommissioning (L-deconf).
